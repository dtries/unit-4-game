Styled, fundametal role-playing battle game. The player first selects their character and will then battle the remaining three opponents, individually. The player selects the first foe and battle with that opponent commences by clicking the attack button. After each attack, damage for the player and the foe are updated and the player can then select to attack again. A given battle is complete once the health for the player or the foe reaches 0. If the player defeated a given foe, they select the next opponent and battle again. This continues until either the player defeats all the foes or the player is defeated. The battle order selected by the player makes a differece as not all orders result in victory. Once the battle is over, the player is offered the option to restart the game.
